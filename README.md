## Verification of Low-rate DoS Attacks Using Formal Verification Tool TLA+ (Kyosuke YAMATANI and Makoto TANABE)

In recent years, there has been an increasing trend in packet traffic associated with cyber attacks on networks, leading to heightened damage. Among these, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are a classic form of cyber attacks that, while generating massive traffic, are relatively straightforward to detect and defend against. However, Low-rate DoS (LDoS) attacks, which execute attacks by generating minimal traffic, pose a greater challenge in terms of detection and defense. Defense methods for LDoS attacks are currently in the research stage. This paper aims to investigate Shrew attacks, a type of LDoS attacks targeting Retransmission Time Out (RTO), using the TLA+ formal specification language. We demonstrate, through definitive transition examples, how TCP communication is impeded by these attacks. This research seeks to provide a framework to deepen the logical discourse surrounding Shrew attacks, enhancing understanding and potential defense strategies.
